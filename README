This is a plugin for Plex Media Server that provides a Plex style interface to the CrunchyRoll web site and videos. This is still in development but currently has an almost completely functional and finished interface.

This plugin is currently only supported for Mac OS X and Plex Media Server version 0.9.5.2 and up.

To install: 
1. Drop CrunchyRoll.bundle into  '/Users/YOURNAME/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/'
2. Check "Disable capability checking" under Plex Media Server preferences->Advanced
3. Restart PMS
4. It should show up under Video Channels in a Plex client

Future plans:
   -Add support for windows version of PMS
   -Try to get premium users full access when using URL service (myPlex or link from library or other plugin)
   -submit to Plex as a full app

This plugin was originally started by pgp90, but was maintained, updated and improved by JeremySH's MAJOR contributions. As such a big thank you to JeremySH for his work.
Additional thanks goes to MattRK for his help with makking this plugin compatable with windows.
